Confidence criteria is essential for identifying ambiguous or hard-to-classify samples within the same domain. Samples with low confidence often lie near decision boundaries, contain noise, or exhibit features that are weakly discriminative. By contrast, high-confidence predictions typically correspond to samples that are well supported by the learned representation. Distinguishing between these cases enables more informed decision-making in downstream tasks such as active learning. Among various confience measures, the true class probability is one of the most intuitive and widely used. It directly reflects how strongly the model believes in the correct label under its learned probability distribution.
