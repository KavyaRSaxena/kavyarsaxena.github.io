I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/), advised by [Prof. Vipul Arora](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00177787).

My doctoral research focuses on domain adaptation, confidence estimation, and uncertainty quantification in Music Information Retrieval (MIR), with a particular emphasis on melody estimation from polyphonic audio signals. More recently, my work has expanded to speech-focused large language models (speech-LLMs), exploring their applications in low-resource automatic speech recognition (ASR) and automatic speech translation (AST).

I hold a B.Tech-M.Tech dual degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Jaypee Institute of Information Technology](https://www.jiit.ac.in/). During my undergraduate studies, I worked on several machine learning–driven projects, which sparked my interest in applied machine learning.
